# Development

## Setup

Add requirements

    pip install -r requirements.txt

It can be helpful to update pip before you start

    pip install --upgrade pip

Activitaing the virtual environment inside the dev container can be done via 

    . atg/bin/activate


## Further thoughts

We should include a GUI. the gui.py file is a great place to find some sample code to get started.
